;; Pheremons is a weight matrix.
;; Every value in it is a floating point number from 0 to 1.
;; The values of this matrix influence the decisions of the ants.
;; Pheremons decay by a fixed amount every tick of the simulation unless
;; an ant has recently traversed that location.
;; The result of this is that long paths do not live as long,
;; so the ants will tend towards the shortest path.
